## Just Baseball


### About This Project
Just Baseball is the last solo project of Front End Mod 3 at Turing and my final project as a student at Turing. The project was designed to consume one API ([MLB Stats API](https://toddrob99.github.io/MLB-StatsAPI/index.html#mlb-statsapi)) and target a specific audience. In this case, the audience was sports fans and more specifically, baseball fans. As a lifelong fan, I am disappointed in the lack of highlight websites applications and wanted something that would make it easier and appeal to people who want highlights and simplicity. This app allows users to navigate through baseball highlights of any game in the API's database. Future implementation will include user's creating an account to save their favorite highlights and see their favorite team's highlights. Implementing keywords into every highlight will allow users to see a new section for specific highlights of home runs or the best highlights of the week. Thank you and I hope you enjoy Just Baseball!

### Learning Goals
- Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of React, Redux, Router, and Asynchronous JavaScript
- Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for your audience which helps them in some way. Your project must utilize your assigned API and technology, and must be built for your assigned audience.
